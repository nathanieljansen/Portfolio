      Hi, I'm Nathaniel Jansen!

    <div class="row introduction center">
     <p>Reintroducing and reinventing myself. I have strong background in process management and development. My past knowledge in technology and business managment has driven me to excel and constantly improve. I love writing code and I'm motivated to develop web applications that are bug free and sophisticated.</p>
      
      <p>It was late in my college career and knowing my interest in web development a family member asked if I'd be willing to build them a site. I had no experience, but felt it was something I'd enjoy. I was immediately hooked, the site was static and bland, but it met her stylistic expectations. It was a great feeling to create something through code.</p> 
      
      <p>I started to wonder if my Business Degree was the right path. Surely, I could work in the industry. Plus, I could always return to school later and pursue a Computer Science degree. Years went by, but I continued to think about making a career out of web developement. My employer for the previous 7 years kept my workload high enough it was difficult to find time to obtain a second degree.</p>

      <p>Then it happened, I got laid off. I immediately knew what the next step was for myself, dive head first into web developement. I looked around for different ways to learn and came across the University of Denver's coding bootcamp.</p>

      <p>Now here I am, a fullstack developer, looking for new challenges and continued growth.</p>
